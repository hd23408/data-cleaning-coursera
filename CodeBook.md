This project is built off of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set available at http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

Here is a link to the original data off of which this cleaned data file is based:

The data produced by this project's "run_analysis.R" script consist of the average for each 
of the "mean" and "standard deviation" variables in the original measurements, for each activity and subject.

Context for the original measurements is as follows:

======================================
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.
======================================

For this cleaned data, only the "mean" and "standard deviation" variables have been kept, and they have been summarized by averaging the values for 
each activity + subject combination. The resulting dataset has the following variables:

Note that the course instructions were unclear as to the scope of the "only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement"
directive, and so I interpreted it to mean *all* of the variables with "mean" or "std" in their names. However, this could also easily be interpreted
as meaning just the "tBodyAcc" mean/std values, in which case the run_analysis.R script could easily be changed (in its "trimmed_measurements <- select"
clause) to restrict the values further.
